## 🌐 Introduction

I recently completed an intensive exploration of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities through Google's renowned XSS Game. This journey took me from fundamental injection techniques to advanced bypass methods, revealing the intricate art of web context manipulation.

> "Understanding XSS is not about breaking systems - it's about mastering how browsers interpret code to build more secure applications."

Here's my complete walkthrough, ranked by difficulty and technical sophistication:

---

## 🏆 Basic Challenges (Levels 1–4)

### 🥇 Level 1: Simple Tag Injection (Difficulty: ★☆☆☆☆)

```html
<img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>
```

- **Technique**: Basic HTML tag injection with error handler execution  
- **Key Insight**: The page directly renders unsanitized input in HTML context  
- **Defense**: HTML entity encoding or proper tag filtering

---

### 🥇 Level 2: Attribute Context Breakout (Difficulty: ★☆☆☆☆)

```html
<img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>
```

- **Technique**: Reused Level 1 payload in attribute context  
- **Key Insight**: Input placed inside HTML tag attributes without sanitization  
- **Defense**: Attribute value quoting and whitelist-based sanitization

---

### 🥈 Level 3: URL Fragment Manipulation (Difficulty: ★★☆☆☆)

```html
'><img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>
```

- **Technique**: Single quote escape + tag injection  
- **Key Insight**: Breaking out of JavaScript string context into HTML  
- **Defense**: Context-aware output encoding

---

### 🥉 Level 4: JavaScript Context Escape (Difficulty: ★★★☆☆)

```html
');prompt('1
```

- **Technique**: Statement termination and new function call  
- **Key Insight**: Breaking out of string literal in JavaScript execution context  
- **Defense**: JSON encoding for dynamic JavaScript values

---

## 🔥 Advanced Challenges (Levels 5–6)

### 🏅 Level 5: Protocol Handler Exploit (Difficulty: ★★★☆☆)

```html
javascript:alert('1')
```

- **Technique**: `javascript:` URI protocol injection  
- **Key Insight**: Some contexts allow execution through navigation handlers  
- **Defense**: Strict URL validation with protocol whitelisting

---

### 🏅 Level 6: Base64 Data URL Bypass (Difficulty: ★★★★☆)

```bash
echo "alert(1)" | base64
# YWxlcnQoMSkK
```

**Payload**:

```
data:undefined;base64,YWxlcnQoMSkK
```

- **Technique**: Base64-encoded script in data URL  
- **Key Insight**: Bypassing filters through alternative execution vectors  
- **Defense**: Complete block of data URIs in sensitive contexts

---

## 💎 Expert Techniques

### 1. SVG XSS Vector

```html
<svg onload=alert(1)>
```

- **Use Case**: When standard tags are filtered but SVG is allowed

---

### 2. Unicode Bypass

```javascript
alert(1)
```

- **Use Case**: Evading basic keyword detection

---

### 3. Template Literal Exploit

```javascript
${alert(1)}
```

- **Use Case**: Breaking out of template literals

---

### 4. Document.domain Manipulation

```html
<script>document.domain=document.domain;alert(1)</script>
```

- **Use Case**: SOP bypass in some legacy configurations

## 🛡️ Defense Matrix

| Vulnerability Type   | Primary Defense           | Secondary Defense               |
|----------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| HTML Injection       | HTML Entity Encoding      | CSP (Content Security Policy)   |
| Attribute XSS        | Attribute Encoding         | Tag Whitelisting                |
| JavaScript Injection | JavaScript Encoding        | Trusted Types                   |
| URL-based XSS        | URL Validation             | Scheme Whitelisting             |
| DOM-based XSS        | Safe DOM APIs              | Output Encoding                 |

---

## 🌟 Conclusion

Through these challenges, I've developed a three-dimensional understanding of XSS:

- **Technical Dimension**: Mastery of injection techniques across contexts  
- **Psychological Dimension**: Thinking like both attacker and defender  
- **Ethical Dimension**: Using knowledge responsibly to improve web security

> "The best XSS protection comes not from filters, but from understanding execution contexts deeply."

This knowledge forms the foundation for advanced web security research and secure coding practices.  
The journey continues with more complex vulnerabilities and protection mechanisms!
